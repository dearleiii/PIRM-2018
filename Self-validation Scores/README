TASK AND EVALUATION
The Task 4x super-resolution of images which were down-sampled with a bicubic kernel.

Evaluation The perception-distortion plane will be divided into three regions defined by thresholds on the RMSE. In each region, the winning algorithm is the one that achieves the best perceptual quality.

Perceptual quality will be quantified by combining the quality measures of [Ma et al.] and [NIQE] by
Perceptual score =1/2 * ((10 − Ma) + NIQE).
Notice that a lower perceptual score indicates better perceptual quality.
See [Blau and Michaeli, CVPR'18] for an explanation of the rationale behind this evaluation method.
