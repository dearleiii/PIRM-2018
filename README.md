THE PIRM CHALLENGE ON PERCEPTUAL SUPER RESOLUTION

PART OF THE PIRM WORKSHOP AT ECCV 2018

Single-image super-resolution has gained much attention in recent years. The appearance of deep neural-net based methods and the great advancement in generative modeling (e.g. GANs) has facilitated a major performance leap. One of the ultimate goals in super-resolution is to produce outputs with high visual quality, as perceived by human observers. However, many works have observed a fundamental disagreement between this recent leap in performance, as quantified by common evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM), and the subjective evaluation of human observers (reported e.g. in the SRGAN and EnhanceNet papers).
